 React Readux Binding 
 React-Redux lib provides:
 1.Provider - In built component, used to pass store object down to react layer.
 2.Connect - It is function used for mapping redux state to react prop 

 /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//Mappers Redux State to React Prop Mapping
/**
 * Mappers are  just function
 * The function must take arg
 *    ->arg is Reducer reference-state
 * The function must return object
 *    ->object is mapper object
 *          {
 *             key:value
 *  *          }
 * key is React prop
 * Value is Redux's state variable
 * Lift is React,Right side is Redux
